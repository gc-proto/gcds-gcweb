## Decision rational
What are we going to do?

- How can we keep the Supertask button [because some research show the success of it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BfqYgcctsE-8IxATOmvirHksAd0f_2INs0EyuzYEG3o/edit#heading=h.9fzn9rvtxnbu)
  - How is it successfully use today
  - CRA ILP
  - Covid response
- Supertask button is optional only on the mandatory Institution Landing Page (ILP) template. Maybe revisiting the scope in the context of the mandatory elements of Canada.ca.
