## Decision rational
What are we going to do?
- Font size are at 16px intentionally, because we wnat to keep some hierarchy between the content and the navigation elements
- Adjust padding so that there's even space right and left of the chevron
- We like the custom icon approach (but icon might need some review)
- Guidance: Clickable should be set to false on static web content and to true for web apps
- Guidance: Breadcrumbs can be customizable in applications
